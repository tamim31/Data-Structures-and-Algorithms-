2. Greedy Algorithms: Examples of greedy approaches to solve various optimization problems.
3. Dynamic Programming (DP): Solutions to common DP problems illustrating memoization and tabulation techniques.
4. Knapsack Problem: Implementation of the 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
5. Huffman Coding: Algorithm for efficient lossless data compression.
6. AVL Tree: Self-balancing binary search tree with insertion, deletion, and rotation operations.
7. Max and Min Algorithms: Algorithms to find maximum and minimum values in data structures.
8. Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of common sorting algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.
